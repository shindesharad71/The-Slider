                                    <p>PHOENIX RapidFire is a revolutionary computer program that helps protect homes and lives
                                        during bushfire season. Designed by University of Melbourne researchers, it can predict
                                        how hot a bushfire might burn, how high the flames will go, and where the embers
                                        might land – all within two minutes of the bushfire being reported. The program delivers
                                        crucial information to trained fire analysts, allowing them to plan an effective
                                        emergency response; giving potential bushfire victims a better and earlier assessment
                                        of the risks to their safety.</p>

                                    <p>The work of University of Melbourne researchers is improving the prognoses of patients
                                        with advanced melanoma across Australia. Oncology pioneers are revolutionising cancer
                                        treatment by creating personalised medicine – targeted therapy for patients that
                                        can help to inform the most effective anaesthesia, the right cancer treatment, and
                                        the frequency and combination of drugs that are used for each individual. This groundbreaking
                                        research requires collaboration between researchers, hospital clinicians and patients
                                        themselves, and harnesses the expertise of leaders in the fields of medicine, genetics
                                        and technology. This research is changing lives.</p>

                                    <p>Accountants and botanists at the University of Melbourne are working together to change
                                        the way we plan our cities of tomorrow. Their groundbreaking research has resulted
                                        in the development of a tool that predicts exactly how much Co2 is absorbed by plants
                                        in Melbourne and climatically similar cities. This allows us to calculate the precise
                                        amount of carbon dioxide that will be removed from the atmosphere by planting certain
                                        trees, shrubs and grasses. Capturing and reporting this information in meaningful
                                        ways will lead to more informed policy by regulators, better decision-making by governments,
                                        investors and businesses - and contribute significantly to our progress towards carbon
                                        neutrality internationally.</p>

                                    Education</div>

                                    <h4>Please describe your role at the university</h4>
                                    <p>I’m a Professor of Higher Education with research interests in access and equity in higher
                                        education, the student experience, quality assurance and standards. In my Pro Vice-Chancellor
                                        (Academic) role I have various responsibilities for quality assurance in teaching
                                        and learning and the planning of the academic workforce.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about working at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>The best things about working at the University is the wide range of diverse and fascinating
                                        people – students and staff — who you encounter each and every day. This is what
                                        makes the University such an intellectually fascinating place to be.</p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the university what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>There are probably a few things I’d like people to know about the University, but perhaps
                                        at the top of my list would be a better public understanding of the breadth and volume
                                        of our research and its value and impact for communities.</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of 'collision' mean to you? How is it manifested at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>For me the idea of collision evokes the ultimate uncertainty about knowledge claims and
                                        the way in which the University must be a forum for respectful debate between individuals
                                        who hold differing and sometimes incommensurable perspectives on things that truly
                                        matter. Collision for me represents the contesting of ideas in a rigorous and robust
                                        way, sometimes within disciplines and fields, and increasingly across them.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video?</h4>
                                    <p>Working on the collision video was a great deal of fun and I must say also highly educational
                                        for me! It was gratifying to work with the other staff and students who were extras
                                        – and to be amazed at the calm patience that was maintained over multiple takes that
                                        extended into the wee hours of the morning. Being an extra isn’t always exciting
                                        – I certainly learnt that.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you believe is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would
                                        like to see the university attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>Well that’s a difficult question. It’s tempting to say climate change and sustainability,
                                        but I’d also like to throw global economic equality into the mix. These mega global
                                        issues require research and action across many disciplines, of course.</p>

                                <div class="more">
                                    <h4>Please describe your role at the university</h4>
                                    <p>I have a great job with responsibility for leading strategy for our libraries that are
                                        so important to our academic mission. In addition I play a similar role in leading
                                        strategy for our rich offering in 30 cultural collections.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about working at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>Working with great minds, experts in their fields and the whole team that is working
                                        together to improve the world.</p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the university what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>There is a very deep commitment to excellence across the University.</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of 'collision' mean to you? How is it manifested at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>I have had the privilege of seeing and learning from other leading universities who have
                                        explored similar ideas. I love how this can bring about change from a focus on STEMM
                                        (science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine) to STEAM (science, technology,
                                        engineering, arts and Medicine). Here at Melbourne this is manifested in the science
                                        students who perform music and the medical students who learn about empathy through
                                        our art museum.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video?</h4>
                                    <p>It was a long, physical and tiring night. But it was exciting to work with the creative
                                        team and most importantly to be with a great bunch of committed students.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you believe is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would
                                        like to see the university attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>The lack of democratic processes across the world is chilling. Melbourne has many experts
                                        that are contributing to the national and international dialogues on democracy in
                                        the 21st century. If we can make a difference to the effect of war and massive dislocation
                                        of communities the world will be a better and safer place.</p>

                                    <p>My role involves overseeing a portfolio that ensures that policies and processes are
                                        fair and equitable to all students. We work closely with other areas of the University
                                        to support students from equity groups including those from regional and remote areas,
                                        students with a disability and those from financially, social or educational disadvantaged
                                        backgrounds. We regularly meet with student groups such as University of Melbourne
                                        Student Union (UMSU) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA) and the Advocacy
                                        Service in UMSU to discuss matters of concern and gain feedback from the student
                                        body. Student complaints and grievances are also handled in this portfolio. There
                                        is a focus on ensuring that all students are aware of the opportunities to engage
                                        in extra curricular activities at University including the 200+ clubs and societies
                                        affiliated with the University.</p>

                                    <p>The people and the campus! Every day I work with interesting people whether they be staff
                                        or students on a beautiful campus that offers staff and students fantastic facilities.
                                        It’s always interesting to hear about the students’ experience in their course and
                                        what research is being undertaken by our outstanding staff.</p>

                                    <p>That the University attracts students from a very broad range of backgrounds. We have
                                        an excellent admissions scheme for students who may have experienced disadvantage
                                        in their schooling.</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of 'collision' mean to you? How is it manifested at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>The idea of collision to me is the way disciplines within the curriculum offered at Melbourne
                                        are not siloed. There is a lot of crossover between faculty/course offerings. Students
                                        studying their course, and particularly in the breadth component of their course,
                                        are exposed to ideas and students outside their discipline area and this opens them
                                        to new ways of thinking.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video?</h4>
                                    <p>It was fun! It’s always interesting to see what goes into preparing for a film/advertisement.
                                        The students were great to work with.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you believe is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would
                                        like to see the university attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>Australia is a large country with many parts that are not utilised because of the scarcity
                                        of water and suitable terrain. With an increased population both here and globally
                                        any contribution we can make to expanding our agricultural output would be welcome.</p>

                                <div class="job">General Manager, Bionic Vision Australia</div>
                                <div class="more">
                                    <h4>Please describe your role at the university</h4>
                                    <p>Bionic Vision Australia (BVA) is a consortium of researchers developing retinal implants,
                                        or ‘bionic eyes’. The headquarters of BVA are located within the Department of Electrical
                                        and Electronic Engineering, part of the Melbourne School of Engineering. I am responsible
                                        for corporate governance, finance, marketing and communications, and stakeholder
                                        engagement of the consortium. I’m also Company Secretary of Bionic Vision Technologies
                                        Pty Ltd, the company established to commercialise the BVA technologies.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about working at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>I love working amongst extremely talented researchers, from postgraduate students through
                                        to the most senior professors. The intellectual environment is outstanding, and constantly
                                        stimulating. It is wonderful to have seen the career progression of very bright young
                                        students through their Masters degree or PhD to the point where they have started
                                        to make their mark in the world, whether in research or industry.</p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the university what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>That the University of Melbourne is not just a destination for high achieving school
                                        leavers, but that there is a whole world of research taking place here.</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of 'collision' mean to you? How is it manifested at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>Collision to me means the bringing together of disparate disciplines and jointly thinking
                                        in new ways to solve complex problems.</p>
                                    <p>The bionic eye is an example of a highly complex problem. The development of an implant
                                        that can be safely implanted into the eye requires expertise in biomedical engineering,
                                        electrical engineering, materials science, neuroscience, vision science, ophthalmology,
                                        integrated circuit design, and surgical, preclinical and clinical practice. Solving
                                        this complex problem would not be possible without expertise from all these disciplines.</p>
                                    <p>At the University of Melbourne, researchers from the Faculties of Engineering, Science,
                                        and Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, along with partner organisations, span
                                        all of these disciplines, and are collaborating with the aim of restoring the sense
                                        of vision to people with vision impairment due to retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video?</h4>
                                    <p>With no pretensions of possessing any acting ability, I never imagined I would be involved
                                        in a professional production like the collision video. With the inevitable waiting
                                        around until called on set, it was great to meet students and other staff members,
                                        and also to observe the process of filmmaking. I feel privileged to have been involved
                                        in the production for the University of Melbourne. I also had great fun.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you believe is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would
                                        like to see the university attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>This is a challenging question to answer. One of the greatest issues that I believe affects
                                        society is greed, being demonstrated by individuals, corporations and nations, and
                                        which has negative consequences for society and the world we live in.</p>
                                    <p>I would like to see the University actively develop new and innovative opportunities
                                        for its students to undertake programs in social responsibility. While some individual
                                        students are involved at a local level with volunteering activities, imagine what
                                        could be achieved by the collision of disciplines through group programs?</p>
                                    <p>An example that comes to mind is a program at Boston University where groups of students
                                        join forces to develop ‘apps’ for not-for-profit organisations. This program brings
                                        together students from many disciplines who not only bring their expertise to the
                                        group, but also have the opportunity to learn new skills, whether coding or marketing.</p>

                                        the enrichment of both. I have the privilege of working across the institution to
                                        strengthen our relationships externally.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about working at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>It’s inspiring being on campus surrounded by so many bright minds working to develop
                                        themselves and make a contribution to the world.</p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the university what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>It has some really great coffee – really!</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of 'collision' mean to you? How is it manifested at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>Collisions are what make the University more than the sum of its parts. Universities
                                        encompass diverse disciplinary knowledge and the functions of teaching, research
                                        and engagement. All of these happen in the same place – the university campus – and
                                        it’s the collisions between them that make the University such a dynamic environment.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video?</h4>
                                    <p>Great fun! It was a genuine collision, working alongside academic staff, professional
                                        colleagues and students.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you believe is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would
                                        like to see the university attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>At the moment I’m interested in how individuals and societies make decisions, and particularly
                                        how these don’t always reflect what we know we ought to be doing. How we can improve
                                        decision making at every level holds significant potential for improving policies,
                                        and through them, wider society. It is perhaps not the single greatest issue, but
                                        it’s one that plays out every day across every aspect of our lives.</p>

                                    <h4>Please describe your role at the university</h4>
                                    <p>I work in the Engagement Strategy team where my role is to research and analyse information
                                        that contributes to the development of engagement strategy and increase the visibility
                                        of the variety of engagement activities in which the University is involved. I also
                                        develop project proposals and coordinate the reporting requirements of the Engagement
                                        portfolio.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about working at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>The wide range of people you can interact with – academics, professional staff and students
                                        – each of whom bring different ideas and experience to the table. The physical campus
                                        environment is a vibrant place to work – there’s always something happening!</p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the university what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>The University is involved in valuable research that touches on so many aspects of all
                                        of our lives. Almost every day I come across another area of research the University
                                        is involved in.</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of 'collision' mean to you? How is it manifested at the university?</h4>
                                    <p>At the point of collision new ideas and solutions emerge, that would otherwise not have
                                        been conceived. The University has experts in so many disciplines, who have achieved
                                        research breakthroughs in their own right. Increasingly though, these great minds
                                        are coming together, through the University, to explore cross-disciplinary ways of
                                        addressing some of society’s biggest issues.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video?</h4>
                                    <p>It was great to be part of something new and creative, with a group of students and staff
                                        who were enthusiastic. It was fascinating to get an inside view on the making of
                                        the film. The downtime between shoots also enabled us to get to know a different
                                        side of our colleagues.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you believe is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would
                                        like to see the university attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>There is already significant work taking place in this at the University, but I think
                                        climate change is the biggest issue we face. If we can influence the climate change
                                        conversation through public policy interaction and research outcomes, hopefully we
                                        will begin to see a significant shift in the thinking, and action, around this issue.</p>

                                    <h4>What did you study at the University and when did you graduate? </h4>
                                    <p>I am a graduate of the school of dance from 2004.</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally? What was your path to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I am originally from Launceston, Tasmania. I began dancing at a late age but quickly
                                        fell in love with it, while dancing for a company called, Stompin. The company had
                                        strong connections to the VCA and after two attempts I was successful in being excepted
                                        into the course.</p>
                                    <h4>Best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>It is hard to pin point one thing that was the best while studying at the VCA. I received
                                        training and advice that is still relevant to me today and also met one of my closet
                                        mentors, Becky Hilton. The course is tough but so is the industry and I can’t thank
                                        Jenny Kinder (Head of Dance) and the VCA enough for what they did for me.</p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you… what are you doing now?</h4>
                                    <p>I have been very lucky throughout my career and now direct my own training course, my
                                        own youth dance company and professional collective of dancers. I make dance, I teach
                                        it and like to be involved in as many different aspects of the form as I can. </p>
                                    <h4>If there is one thing you would like people to know about the University would would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>I am an Almuni of the VCA and my affiliation with the University outside of my time as
                                        a dancer has been limited but it excites me very much that the University would take
                                        on a project like this collision video. I think more people in need to know about
                                        the work and the achievements of the University. </p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of collision mean to you? How is it manifested at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>Dancing for me has always been about the people I do it with. We, as creatives, are continually
                                        colliding physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Hoping to create something
                                        that can inspire dialogue, more art making and enhance our way of life as we know
                                        it.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video? What was your role?</h4>
                                    <p>I worked as one of the movement consultants/ choreographers. I brought together some
                                        fantastic contemporary artists who worked alongside students from the VCA other students
                                        and members of the University’s staff and faculty. Exit Films were just brilliant
                                        to work with and the shoot days were long, exciting, exhilarating and I just can’t
                                        wait to see the final outcome.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you believe is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would
                                        like to see the university attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>Again to single out just one issue is close to impossible but I feel very strongly about
                                        the notion of sustainability. In regards to our planet, our resources, the future
                                        of our children and of course our arts and culture. </p>
                                    <h4>How was it for you coming back to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>Proud to be part of such a massive team and excited to give back to the University that
                                        gave so much to me.</p>

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the university and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>I am studying a BFA in Theatre Practice and I am in second year.</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the university?</h4>
                                    <p>I am originally from Dresden in Germany. I moved to Sydney five years ago where I completed
                                        a BA in Theatre, Performance and Film Studies. I had always been curious to spend
                                        some time living in the Southern Hemisphere as my mum is originally from New Zealand.
                                        I was actually planning on moving back home, to Berlin, when I got the acceptance
                                        letter from the VCA. That was pretty exciting, so here I am.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>To finally be gaining experience in what I ultimately want to do, which is be a performer.
                                        This is such a great opportunity to hone your skills, meet people you will be entering
                                        the industry with, fostering creative relationships, learning from industry professionals
                                        and quite simply growing and gaining confidence as an artist.</p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you...</h4>
                                    <p>As previously mentioned I am German and Kiwi. I grew up in Europe however over the years
                                        my family has travelled to New Zealand and Australia a lot as we have relatives down
                                        here. I actually have an auntie in Sydney which made the transition a lot easier.
                                        My performance background is mainly in physical theatre and in dance, even though
                                        mum would probably argue that it goes right back to when I was still in diapers.
                                        In my downtime I love to cook, read and do yoga. Other than that I am a pretty active
                                        person. I go on hikes quite a bit, horseback ride, and love surfing and snowboarding
                                        with my brothers!</p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the university what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>It's a community full of warm, creative, fun people!</p>
                                    <h4>What does the idea 'Collision' mean to and how does it manifest itself at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>We have the unique opportunity to collaborate with people from different streams here,
                                        both in class and in shows - and what has been particularly great during the making
                                        of the collision video is that it has involved students from all different faculties
                                        and also academic staff. It has been a really collaborative effort!</p>
                                    <h4>What do you think is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would like
                                        to see the University attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>I would really like to see the University of Melbourne more openly and more actively
                                        support the welcoming and integration of refugees. Recently an initiative that has
                                        been described as Airbnb for refugees has been launched in Germany. Citizens can
                                        sign up to a website on which you can offer to welcome a refugee into your home.
                                        Rent will mostly be covered by micro donations to the site or governmental aid. And
                                        in fact the response has been overwhelming especially from the student demographic,
                                        as flat shares often have an extra room or bed. This model seems to be successful
                                        and is being used to set up similar schemes in Europe. I believe this can be done
                                        here too. This kind of humanitarian initiative would greatly benefit from having
                                        such a prestigious and influential body as the University of Melbourne lead by example
                                        and support it.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do when you graduate?</h4>
                                    <p>I always saw myself on a theatre, live performance trajectory. However I have really
                                        enjoyed working on this production and have gained a much better understanding of
                                        film performance and that you are faced with an entirely different set of challenges.
                                        I am definitely also going to pursue screen acting! As for the idea of collision
                                        in the future: I believe the arts and politics could collide a bit more. And I mean
                                        this on a very practical level. If I have learnt anything during my degree it is
                                        that fostering a stronger kinesthetic awareness of self centers you, opens you up
                                        and helps make you more genuinely empathetic. I feel like this is a very useful addition
                                        to anyone's life. I have always enjoyed the thought of Obama, Putin and Merkel engaged
                                        in contact improvisation. Maybe I can make that happen. :D</p>

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the University and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>I am studying a bachelor of fine arts in dance. I am in my third and final year.</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I am from central Australia, Alice Springs. I had always heard of the VCA and wanted
                                        join since the age of 14. Encouraged by teachers. I took a leap of faith auditioned
                                        and was welcomingly accepted into the University. </p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>Living in Melbourne. Learning the skills, getting experience being so close to the dance
                                        Hub of Australia. </p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you...</h4>
                                    <p>I am a well-traveled girl, who has always had a passionate interest in pursuing a career
                                        involving the human body. I have spent many years cross training in Circus Arts,
                                        Sports and Martial Arts. Which have all contributed to developing me as an artist.
                                        </p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the university what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>It is a very great career choice and provides lots of guidance and unlimited career outcomes.
                                        </p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of ‘Collision’ mean to you and how does it manifest itself at the
                                        University?</h4>
                                    <p>For me it comes from the facts that the University of Melbourne has such a diverse platter
                                        of disciplines all aims at producing such multifaceted and talented graduates.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video and what was your role? Water/hand/skull
                                        etc?</h4>
                                    <p>It was very rewarding in terms of experience.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you think is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would like
                                        to see the University attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>Climate Change / Renewable energy sources.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do when you graduate? </h4>
                                    <p>Become a professional dancer. And a physiotherapist. Yes it can be done! </p>

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the University and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>This is my first semester at the University and I am pursuing a Master of Engineering
                                        (Mechanical).</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally? What was you path to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I was born and brought up in Mumbai, India. I pursued my Bachelor in Engineering (Mechanical)
                                        from the University of Mumbai. My interests to delve into this stream piqued my curiosity
                                        to explore Mechanical Engineering. This has had since developed into a staunch determination
                                        to specialise in it. The University of Melbourne, being among the leading university
                                        for this course, was no less than a dream for me. My earnest interest in this field
                                        backed by hard work and consistency paved my way to this University.</p>
                                    <h4>What’s the best thing about studying at the University? </h4>
                                    <p>The best thing about the University is the world-class education that they provide. Great
                                        guidance from the distinguished faculty and interaction with accomplished classmates
                                        is contributing to my overall development every single day. </p>
                                    <h4>Tell is a bit more about you...</h4>
                                    <p>I have always believed in a well-balanced lifestyle. In parallel to academics, I have
                                        always been passionate about my hobbies. I am a trained swimmer. I have represented
                                        my University and school in the highly competitive sport of swimming and won numerous
                                        medals, at various national and state level tournaments. Apart from sports, I have
                                        a fascination for Indian Classical Music and have been trained up to the penultimate
                                        level. I have tutored underprivileged children through NGOs like ‘The Children of
                                        the World (India) Trust’, ‘The Akshansha Foundation’ amongst others and experienced
                                        the ‘joy of giving’ in its truest sense. This multi-faceted exposure has always kept
                                        me on my toes and I wish to continue to indulge myself in various activities in this
                                        University and Melbourne as well. On the lighter side, I am a foodie and I love travelling.</p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the University what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>The one thing I would like people to know about the University is about all the quaint
                                        little places the university comprises of. Places like the Old Quad, South lawn,
                                        the GSA lounge are some of my favourites and the most beautiful spots in the University.
                                        In spite of being full with students most of the time; you can still find your own
                                        little space to indulge in and find peace of mind.</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of collision mean to you? How is it manifested at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>The idea of collision means all the different streams coming together to serve a bigger
                                        purpose. My recent experience of collision was when different schools in the University
                                        came together to shoot for the campaign. Academically for me, my course has utmost
                                        flexibility and lets me choose from various other streams like electrical engineering,
                                        business and management. The University’s prestigious masters program combines core-engineering
                                        subjects with techno-management streams and hence the idea of collision is manifested
                                        for me at the University in this way. </p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the brand film? What was your role? Hand/Water/Tree/Skull
                                        etc?</h4>
                                    <p>I have had a few prior experience of shooting. But the experience of working on this
                                        brand film was extremely different. I was a part of the hand and the tree team. I
                                        used my previous climbing skills for my role in this movie. I made many new friends
                                        in the sets. The shoot was fun and entertaining. Coming from engineering, amidst
                                        the tight schedule, the shoot served the purpose of a refreshing experience. It gives
                                        me great pride in being a part of this one of a kind brand campaign. </p>
                                    <h4>What do you believe is the single greatest issue facing society that you would like to
                                        see the University attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>In my opinion, the single greatest issue the society is facing today is the extreme change
                                        in the environment, which has resulted to global warming. Today’s fast paced society
                                        and its people tend to ignore the obvious and drastic changes in the climate. According
                                        to me, I would personally want the University to attempt to tackle it and I’d do
                                        my bit towards it as well if given a chance.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do once you graduate?</h4>
                                    <p>I know that a Master of Engineering (Mechanical) from the University of Melbourne will
                                        imbibe me with the required skills for a long-term career and will help me gain a
                                        foothold in this field. I wish to study further and pursue a PHD, hopefully from
                                        the University of Melbourne itself, in the subject that interest me the most during
                                        my course of study here.</p>

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the university and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>I study acting, well, actually, ‘theatre practice’, which means I’ll finish my course
                                        with the skills to both occupy the screen and stage, but am also capable of creating
                                        new work from the ground up. I’m in the second of a three-year course. </p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the university?</h4>
                                    <p>I’m from Melbourne, and was one of those lucky folk to come straight from high school.
                                        There is a lot going for the University of Melbourne and so I was really attracted
                                        to the idea of studying at the institution, and knew that if it wasn’t acting at
                                        VCA, it was certainly Arts at Melbourne Uni. </p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University? </h4>
                                    <p>The quality of the training at VCA is incredible. I’m very, very lucky to experience
                                        such top- notch training under such regarded professionals. I’m continuously reminded
                                        about just how well I’m being schooled in my craft, and the artistic qualifications
                                        I’m going to emerge with, and that’s very exciting to me.</p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you...</h4>
                                    <p>I’m twenty years old, and grew up in the suburb of St. Kilda. I was fortunate to go to
                                        two really great schools with really great teachers- Elwood Secondary College and
                                        Sandringham College, where I received a strong foundational education in the arts
                                        and the craft of acting, which helped springboard me into VCA. </p>
                                    <h4>What does the idea of 'Collision' mean to you and how does it manifest itself at the
                                        University?</h4>
                                    <p>The thing that occurs to me is the collision of ideas. When two creative entities meet
                                        and something dangerous happens. It’s always a joy when, and it’s never often enough,
                                        the dancers and the actors, or the artists and the musicians, collaborate and reveal
                                        something I’ve never seen before- and I think what’s clear to me is that distinctions
                                        between creative disciplines aren’t as profound as we sometimes think them to be;
                                        that it’s all beautifully connected.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you think is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would like
                                        to see the University attempt to tackle? </h4>
                                    <p>That’s too tough a question. There are plenty of large issues facing society, but if
                                        there’s something I’ve been focusing on in my work of late, it is the lack of awareness
                                        surrounding the alarming prevalence of sexual assault. That is, I believe, a very
                                        real issue that occurs in high frequency that not all, but many, could come to understand
                                        more.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do when you graduate?</h4>
                                    <p>Begin working right away! I look forward to starting my career as a professional actor
                                        and establishing myself as a working artist in Melbourne, and continue expanding
                                        my understanding of my craft and the world.</p>

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the University and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>I am a 2nd year Bachelor of Commerce student</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally? What was you path to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I am from Malaysia. I got accepted into the University of Melbourne after completing
                                        A-Levels.</p>
                                    <h4>What’s the best thing about studying at the University? </h4>
                                    <p>I am able to meet and interact with people from around the world, more importantly learning
                                        - I learn something new every day.</p>
                                    <h4>Tell is a bit more about you…</h4>
                                    <p>I enjoy learning new skills and helping people. I spend my free time in different kinds
                                        of training, to develop my mental strength. </p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the University</h4>
                                    <p>The community is full of warm and fun people - don’t be afraid to seek help!</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of collision mean to you? How is it manifested at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I can only think of collision of ideas. Collision means to be creative and innovative,
                                        when two different ideas collide, we come out with something new. In the University
                                        of Melbourne, we have to take subjects from different faculties as breadth. This
                                        is the best opportunity for us to have a taste of different courses, leading to new
                                        perspectives and ideas.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the brand film? What was your role? Hand/Water/Tree/Skull
                                        etc?</h4>
                                    <p>It was a great opportunity for me, I never thought I would be involved in such large
                                        scale production like the brand film. I was part of water, I certainly had fun, and

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the University and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>I am a second year Actor at VCA.</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I grew up in Sydney and moved down to Melbourne when I found out I got In to VCA. I auditioned
                                        for VCA as well as NIDA in Sydney and after the first audition I knew that VCA was
                                        where I was supposed to be, and I haven't looked back since.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>We have access to such incredible and sought after teachers, which makes for a really
                                        supportive, explorative and creative learning environment.</p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you...</h4>
                                    <p>I'm 25 and have been married for 2yrs. </p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the University what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>I don't know about the whole university but the teachers at VCA are very passionate about
                                        their work and passionate teachers find a way for everyone to learn, not just the
                                        ones who fit the mold. Don't be scared off if you found high school hard. Real teachers
                                        know how to teach.</p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of ‘Collision’ mean to you and how does it manifest itself at the
                                        University?</h4>
                                    <p>It means getting to work with a whole range of students that are studying to be the best
                                        in their field. We all have a long way to go but the passion is infectious and it
                                        fosters great collaborative relationships.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video and what was your role? Water/hand/skull
                                        etc?</h4>
                                    <p>I played a little part in all of it, I got to be in the water, forearm, skull and in
                                        some of the background shots, it was great to see all the different parts come together.
                                        With so many moving parts I think the crew did a great job, I certainly had fun.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you think is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would like
                                        to see the University attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>Taking care of our planet. So much more can be done to lessen the footprint we leave
                                        on the world and the more people that actively engage in doing so the bigger impact
                                        we can have. Big University, big chance for change.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do when you graduate? </h4>
                                    <p>Melbourne has a great theatre scene and I would love to be apart of it. I also want to

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the University and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>I am in the first year of my Bachelor of Science.</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I was born in Boston and moved to Australia when I was about 10. I knew I wanted to study
                                        at the University of Melbourne during year 12 when my brother and older friends told
                                        me how incredible it is. </p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>The atmosphere at the uni is really unique; there are so many events for students and
                                        ways to get involved. I love meeting like-minded people who also appreciate the importance
                                        of student life. Besides the social aspect, the lecturers are very supportive and
                                        always offer extra assistance if needed.</p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you…</h4>
                                    <p>I am looking to major in Physiology and currently considering sports physiotherapy after
                                        undergrad. In the mean time I am involved in many of the events and clubs at the
                                        campus and am getting to know as many people as possible. I have also joined the
                                        cheerleading team and am going to participate in Australia's University Games at
                                        the Gold Coast this year.</p>

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the University and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>A Bachelor of Fine Arts (Theatre Practice) at the VCA. I’m a second year Actor.</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I’m originally from Central Victoria. After going to boarding school I moved to Melbourne
                                        to commence my University studies at La Trobe. I’d been involved in Theatre for about
                                        6 years before being accepted into the BFA program.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>Friendship. We are all here to do our best and support each other in the realisation
                                        of our dreams. That’s a special kind of bond that you don’t really find anywhere
                                        else, outside of family. To me, my class is one big family. It’s also the beginnings
                                        of a professional network for all of us, which is challenging and rewarding. </p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you...</h4>
                                    <p>I am absolutely a country boy at heart. The older I get the more proud of that I am.
                                        I’ll never miss an opportunity to go camping with friends, or just relax around a
                                        fire at home with family. I wear flannel shirts a lot, sometimes without washing
                                        them. I’m really ambitious, I find that to be an equally scary and exhilarating quality.
                                        Other people would probably consider me to be quite introverted and I suppose that’s
                                        true in most cases. At first I’ll stand back and watch, learn, consider, then jump
                                        in and excel. I’m a lot like my Dad in that regard. I care about others a lot. I
                                        want to make sure everyone around me is taken care of. I got that from my Mum. The
                                        most valuable change that has occurred in me since being at the University of Melbourne
                                        is that I’m becoming a more consistent hard worker. My parents are definitely proud
                                        of that.</p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the University what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>You get out what you put in. Immersion is always going to be the key to success. UniMelb
                                        has a lot to offer, and considering its city location, you have easy access to a
                                        lot of Melbourne’s nightlife and culture. At the VCA we can pretty much stroll out
                                        of class and into a Theatre every evening if we have the time. </p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of ‘Collision’ mean to you and how does it manifest itself at the
                                        University?</h4>
                                    <p>I guess it’s referring to the blending of ideas for the creation of something new and
                                        progressive. In my experience there is a great deal of “Collision” that happens at
                                        the VCA amongst the various BFA streams. For example, I’m currently working with
                                        writers, directors and dramaturgy students on a collaborative project over the next
                                        eight weeks. We are working together to create a new piece of Theatre in a completely
                                        egalitarian process involving workshops, practical studio sessions, and tutorials
                                        with our outstanding Lecturers. This will end with a performance to the faculty that
                                        we are absolutely not freaking out about. </p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video and what was your role? Water/hand/skull
                                        etc?</h4>
                                    <p>I was a part of the water, the hand, and the skull from early in the rehearsal process.
                                        I had such a fun time hanging out with my classmates and getting to meet industry
                                        professionals. It was an enlightening experience to see what happens on a professional
                                        film shoot, considering that’s where I’ll be heading after I graduate. I’m proud
                                        that my first professional gig was for my Uni! </p>
                                    <h4>What do you think is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would like
                                        to see the University attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>Global Warming. There’s a lot that can be done to lessen our negative impact on the world.
                                        Far more than is being done currently. I’d really like to see the University produce
                                        graduates that can help change things if they chose to, be it from within private
                                        Industry or government. Hopefully we can all grow to be sensitive to this sort of
                                        issue and make good life decisions in terms of our own footprint. Everyone can afford
                                        to walk a little lighter. </p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do when you graduate?</h4>
                                    <p>I’ll be working in Theatre and Television as much as possible. I’m in a tough field,
                                        but I’ll make it work for me. I’ll have a really solid foundation after completing
                                        my BFA, and I’m excited for the challenges the real world has for me. </p>

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the University and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Arts majoring in politics and international studies
                                        minoring in law in social justice. I am in my third year of university and I will
                                        be graduating at the end of the semester. </p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I was born in the small town of Taiping in West Malaysia. I lived there for 15 years
                                        before moving to Melbourne in 2009. My family and I moved for a better life and to
                                        flee what we felt was oppression of minorities, which was rampant in the public school
                                        system as well as the work sectors. We had enough and my dad was lucky enough to
                                        be offered a job under skilled migration in the mid 2000s courtesy of Kevin Rudd’s
                                        new policy. I then attend Marcellin College in Bulleen for VCE before joining the
                                        University of Melbourne in 2012. </p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>The best thing about Melbourne University is that it really offers an excellent quality
                                        education and the opportunity to balance study with social and extra curricular activities.
                                        I have been a part of the Elite Athlete Program at the University for the last two
                                        years as a middle/long distance runner. This recognition meant that I could easily
                                        balance running 120km per week and a full time study load. Besides that, clubs and
                                        societies that allow for an awesome social life, and of course the beautiful buildings
                                        and architecture that the University campus has to offer. </p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you...</h4>
                                    <p>As I have mentioned above I enjoy running a lot, and have been actively competing in
                                        the sport since competing and placing third at the World Schools Cross Country Championships
                                        in 2012 as part of the Australian team. Besides this, I am an avid musician and often
                                        spend my spare time song writing, playing the guitar or West African Percussion.
                                        I keep a really active social life and was involved in the Melbourne Arts Student
                                        Society as the Events Coordinator for one term in 2014. These few things allow me
                                        to keep a good balance between all aspects of my life. </p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the University what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>One thing people should know is that we have great coffee at the University of Melbourne.
                                        I know that really only matters if you like coffee, but I didn’t drink coffee before
                                        coming to Melbourne and am now a self-confessed coffee addict courtesy of the café
                                        culture at the University. </p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of ‘Collision’ mean to you and how does it manifest itself at the
                                        University?</h4>
                                    <p>Allow me to get real Arts student for a second.</p>
                                    <p>The idea of Collision in its simplest form is the symbiosis between all faculties at
                                        the University. It is a mix of the University’s different studies, programs, faculties,
                                        expertise and cultures. The manifestation of this is not really physically embodied
                                        in anything particularly; rather it transcends pre-existing boundaries that each
                                        faculty is its own separate thing. The programs at the University allow for study
                                        from all areas - from science to fine arts and everything in between. </p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video and what was your role? Water/hand/skull
                                        etc?</h4>
                                    <p>I was part of the Hand team, and I was the fourth finger in the advertisement. The experience
                                        was fun and not to different to the roles I’ve had in past short film productions.
                                        The difference was the team I was working with was all like-minded students from
                                        the University, so we had a lot in common and a lot of similar things to talk about.
                                        It made the filming run really smooth and easy.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you think is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would like
                                        to see the University attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>As this advertisement was being filmed Tony Abbott agreed to increase the refugee intake
                                        from the Syrian refugee crisis to 12,000. This is a good attempt by Australia but
                                        I believe we need to do more as a human race for people persecuted by war and extreme
                                        acts of terror. The only difference between these refugees and me is that I came
                                        to Australia by plane. My heart goes out to all people who are trying to flee persecution
                                        and violence for a better life and we as a human race still can’t band together and
                                        help people in these predicaments. Everyone deserves the right to live in peace and
                                        harmony, and I think the next few years will define us as a human race in terms of
                                        how we respond to the crisis in the Middle East and Africa. The University is tackling
                                        this issue already by educating visionaries of the future. Many students from the
                                        University will end up in NGOs or government organisations that help the current
                                        situations in the world. So I think they are already on the right track. </p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do when you graduate?</h4>
                                    <p>Once I graduate I hope to do postgraduate study either at the Melbourne Law School or
                                        Melbourne Business School. However before this I intend to take some time off to
                                        travel and train without the stresses of University for a few important running races
                                        in the near future. </p>

                                    <p>I’m doing a Bachelor of Arts and I’m in my third year. I’m on my fourth academic year
                                        due to under-loading and balancing my rowing training.</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I’m born and bred in Melbourne. I moved over to Ireland during my primary school years
                                        and then back to Melbourne to start secondary school at St Kevin’s College (tying
                                        in with the Irish roots). I studied my butt off and it paid dividends when I received
                                        an acceptance letter from the University of Melbourne for my undergraduate studies
                                        in 2012.</p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>The University of Melbourne has been extremely supportive of my sporting commitments.
                                        Carl Junot, the Elite Athlete Coordinator, has enabled me to seamlessly balance my
                                        academic and sporting endeavours throughout my undergraduate course. This makes it
                                        easier for me to train/compete at a high level, while also maintaining high academic
                                        grades.</p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you...</h4>
                                    <p>I’m currently studying a BA and majoring in media and communication, which is perfect
                                        for me because my mates have often described me as a “social media fiend”. I’m an
                                        elite rower for Mercantile Rowing Club and have represented the University of Melbourne
                                        at the Australian Boat Race and University Games. While this keeps me busy, with
                                        the help of the University I’ve been able to balance my studies, work and rowing
                                        cohesively. I’m pursuing a career in marketing and in the immediate future I hope
                                        to find opportunities that compliment this area. I’m also gearing up to complete
                                        a 1100km Ride to Cure MND from Sydney to Melbourne in early December this year for
                                        the Neale Daniher’s Cure for MND Foundation. </p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the University what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>The culture at the University is second to none. The students are amazing and highly
                                        driven – it’s an infectious environment to be a part of. The staff has been extremely
                                        approachable and supportive to any issues I’ve had during my undergraduate course.
                                        With the appropriate level of communication, any personal/academic/private issues
                                        are quickly resolved. </p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of ‘Collision’ mean to you and how does it manifest itself at the
                                        University?</h4>
                                    <p>Giving students the choice to mix and match different subjects, so that they’re able
                                        to pursue their unique academic goals in whatever area they’re interested in. For
                                        myself, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts but I have still had the opportunity to
                                        further my studies in Accounting (Commerce Faculty) and Creative Arts (VCA Faculty)
                                        because I have a flare for business and creativity as well as media and communications.</p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the collision video and what was your role? Water/hand/skull
                                        etc?</h4>
                                    <p>I was the index finger on the hand and a branch on the tree.</p>
                                    <p>Although shooting the brand film was a tiring/long process (as the film industry is renowned
                                        for), I met a lot of other students who had similar sporting interests to myself.
                                        If I could, I would definitely be a part of something like the brand film again because
                                        I met some of my best University mates during it and I wouldn’t have had that opportunity
                                        otherwise.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you think is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would like
                                        to see the University attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>I’d have to say finding a cure for Motor Neutron Disease (MND). There is currently no
                                        cure for this debilitating disease and every 12 hours, someone in Australia is diagnosed.
                                        In the same time frame another Australian will die from the disease. In the latest
                                        Government NHMRC Grants, only $2m (0.5% of the total $420m) was allocated to MND
                                        research). The current estimated cost of caring for someone with MND is $300,000.
                                        The goal that I’d like to see the University of Melbourne tackle is to find a cure
                                        for the disease, volunteer staff and students to care for those who have MND and
                                        push the disease into the spotlight to make our country aware of the devastating
                                        affect it can have on those diagnosed.</p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do when you graduate?</h4>
                                    <p>Move into a postgraduate marketing course at Melbourne Business School – I never want
                                        to leave this place</p>

                                    <h4>What are you studying at the University and what year are you in?</h4>
                                    <p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Fine Arts: Theatre Practice and am in second year.</p>
                                    <h4>Where are you from originally and what was your pathway to the University?</h4>
                                    <p>I’m from Melbourne and my journey to the University was a simple one – I knew I wanted
                                        to pursue acting and I knew the VCA was one of the leading institutions to do so,
                                        so I made sure I did as much as I could to be accepted. </p>
                                    <h4>What is the best thing about studying at the University?</h4>
                                    <p>Genuinely the people. I’ve met so many interesting and different people in my course
                                        and across the VCA campus that have inspired me and taught me new things. The great
                                        thing about the VCA is that there is always something happening, new people to meet
                                        and collaborate with, so there is never a dull moment. </p>
                                    <h4>Tell us a bit more about you…..</h4>
                                    <p>I’m Izabella, I’m 20 years old and am your typical aspiring actress, working as a waitress
                                        on the weekends and serving customers in different accents. I speak a little bit
                                        of Spanish and Greek and can quote most of Good Will Hunting. </p>
                                    <h4>If there was one thing you would like people to know about the University what would
                                        it be?</h4>
                                    <p>How much fun we actually have at the VCA. A normal day can consist of a mixture of acrobatics,
                                        singing, dancing with each other (not necessarily well, I might add) and pretending
                                        to be other people and putting on funny voices. It’s everything you dream of as a
                                        six year old. </p>
                                    <h4>What does this idea of ‘Collision’ mean to you and how does it manifest itself at the
                                        University?</h4>
                                    <p>To me the idea of Collision means the fusion of two different schools of work or bodies
                                        of ideas/concepts. At the University I see it manifest itself most in the clubs and
                                        societies where people from across the University can meet and socialise. In a more
                                        professional sense Collision is happening all the time at the VCA when we get the
                                        opportunity to work with designers or directors or people from other disciplines
                                        to create something. </p>
                                    <h4>How was your experience working on the brand film and what was your role? Water/hand/skull
                                        etc?</h4>
                                    <p>My role in the brand film was being a part of the skull and hand. I found the experience
                                        overall quite informative and great for gaining experience in front of a camera.
                                        I found it extraordinarily interesting to see how all the elements of a film shoot
                                        work together to create the actual film and what is required from the actors or extras
                                        in these circumstances. </p>
                                    <h4>What do you think is the single greatest issue facing society today that you would like
                                        to see the University attempt to tackle?</h4>
                                    <p>There are so many, limiting myself to one almost makes me feel guilty for prioritising
                                        one issue over the other. I think domestic violence is reaching a level of epidemic
                                        in Australia at the moment that needs to be addressed, I also think the treatment
                                        of asylum seekers is something we should be actively trying to improve as a nation
                                        and government. </p>
                                    <h4>What do you hope to do when you graduate?</h4>
                                    <p>I hope to be working as an actress on stage, film and TV.</p>

                    <h3>How do universities achieve all they do?</h3>
                    <p>Are breakthroughs created by lonely geniuses sitting around in attics and laboratories, generating great
                        ideas on their own? Or are they created in business-like fashion by teams working on carefully articulated
                        problems?</p>
                    <p>The first appeals to our heroic sensibilities, the second to our managerialist tendencies. And while
                        there is something in both, let me suggest a third way. Through the collision of genius, ambition
                        and passion taking place at universities.</p>
                    <p>Universities bring brilliant people together who collectively advance knowledge, mould our societies
                        and change the way we understand the world.</p>
                    <p>Examples of great minds colliding at universities and impacting our world are plentiful. Roger Penrose
                        and the very young Stephen Hawking together at the University of Cambridge formulated the Big Bang
                        as an explanation of the origins of the universe. Also at Cambridge, Francis Crick and James Watson
                        together drew upon the work of Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling from the University of London
                        to discover the structure of life itself – DNA. Here at the University of Melbourne, Professor Graeme
                        Clark and his team pioneered the research and development of the Bionic Ear – the Cochlear Implant.</p>
                    <p>Beyond science, important youthful intellectual movements have come from the humanities: the Romantic
                        Movement from 1800 to 1850; the Bloomsbury Set of writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists
                        such as Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes and E. M. Forster; the Great War poets. These young,
                        brilliant, ambitious people were thrown together at university but carried on their conversations
                        after graduation. They changed the way we view poetry, literature, art, economics and war. It’s barely
                        possible to think about the most momentous issues facing us today without at least subconscious reference
                        to the intellectual frames they constructed – especially in a world of threatened freedoms, economic
                        uncertainty and military conflict.</p>
                    <p>These movements came not just from the lecture theatres and laboratories inside universities, but from
                        the nature of universities as places where young people live, love, socialise, compete, debate, make
                        friends and set their path in life.</p>
                    <p>That’s what I see when I walk around the University of Melbourne campus and hear in the surrounding cafes
                        and bars and bookshops: restless energy bouncing off itself, creating the future and defining the
                        way we will interpret it.</p>
                    <p>On this site we explore how we contribute to these great stories of collision. I invite you to consider
                        their relevance and all they suggest about the importance of the work that occurs at the University
                        of Melbourne.</p>
